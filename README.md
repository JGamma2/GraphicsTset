This is a basic 3d graphics engine as built by 3DSage in this video and the following.

This engine was based on the Wolfenstein 3D raycasting engine, and written in C using OpenGL.
This engine is instead written in JS and rendered using the WebGL canvas.
I want a basic engine that can render various maps, with walls, ceilings, floors, a sky, and texture capabilites.
This can be a good starting point for different potential games, all using the same engine.
